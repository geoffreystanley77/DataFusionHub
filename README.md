# Project Name: DataFusionHub

## Overview:
DataFusionHub is a comprehensive data integration platform designed to streamline the process of merging and consolidating data from multiple sources. It provides a unified interface for managing data integration tasks, ensuring data consistency and accuracy across the organization.

## Features:
- **Data Source Connectivity:** Connect to various data sources including databases, APIs, files, and cloud services.
- **Data Transformation:** Transform and cleanse data using built-in tools and functions to prepare it for integration.
- **Automated Data Merging:** Automate the process of merging and consolidating data from disparate sources.
- **Data Quality Control:** Implement data quality checks and validations to ensure the accuracy and consistency of integrated data.
- **Scalability:** Scale seamlessly to handle large volumes of data and complex integration scenarios.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Monitor integration jobs in real-time and track changes with comprehensive logging.

## Getting Started:
1. **Installation:** Install DataFusionHub using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install datafusionhub
    ```
2. **Initialization:** Initialize DataFusionHub in your project directory:
    ```bash
    datafusionhub init
    ```
3. **Connect Data Sources:** Connect to your data sources using the provided connectors:
    ```python
    from datafusionhub import DataConnector

    connector = DataConnector()
    connector.connect_to_database('database_url')
    connector.connect_to_api('api_endpoint')
    ```
4. **Define Integration Jobs:** Define integration jobs to merge and consolidate data:
    ```python
    from datafusionhub import IntegrationJob

    job = IntegrationJob()
    job.create_job('job_name', source_data, target_database)
    job.run_job()
    ```
5. **Monitor Integration:** Monitor integration jobs and review logs for any issues or errors:
    ```bash
    datafusionhub monitor --job_id <job_id>
    ```

## Usage:
```python
from datafusionhub import DataConnector, IntegrationJob

# Connect to data sources
connector = DataConnector()
connector.connect_to_database('database_url')
connector.connect_to_api('api_endpoint')

# Define integration job
job = IntegrationJob()
job.create_job('job_name', source_data, target_database)
job.run_job()
